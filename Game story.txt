Game story:

While doing a routine spacewalk, your ship was attacked by interdimensional aliens and exploded. The blast threw you into a non-Euclidean pocket of space where the rules of spacetime are broken. You must find a loose transponder module you saw in order to call for help. The alien is still after you as well...
